# Product Unit

Product Units are a convenient way to manage products, which are typically traded in larger quantities.

If you for example trade with wine and usually sell/buy wine in boxes of 6, you can create a "Box" Unit on the Wine <Link href="/main-entities/product">Product<Link>.

## Fields

### Name

The Name field defines the name of the unit to identify it later on.

### Base Amount

The Base Amount field defines the amount of units of the product which makes up this product unit.
